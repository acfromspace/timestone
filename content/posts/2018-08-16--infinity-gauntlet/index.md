From colleagues I get posed with the specifics of the software and hardware I use.

Since I usually adapt and find cool things often, this will be the reference point of my findings that hopefully will be beneficial for you as well.

### Editor + Plugins

- <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> is the text editor I use that provides a built in terminal as well as an assortment of plugins in the store ready to download. 
- <a href="https://github.com/acfromspace/infinitygauntlet" target="_blank">Plugins</a></a> for Visual Studio Code will be located here as well as my music.
- <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode" target="_blank">Fira code</a></a> is the text editor font I use which provides easy readability that makes sense.


### Software

- I'm on Windows 10!
- <a href="https://tinyurl.com/wiztreeprogam" target="_blank">Wiz Tree</a> is hard drive organizer I use, shows what's taking up space on your drives via colorful squares.
- <a href="https://www.voidtools.com/" target="_blank">Everything</a> is the hard drive file seeker I use. I kept using the Windows Explorer but took too long to find a certain file, this application finds it in a *snap*.

### Hardware

- <a href="https://www.acer.com/ac/en/GB/content/model/NX.GKBEK.002" target="_blank">Acer Swift 3</a> is the laptop I use for coding.
- I do have a desktop computer as well though I should be upgrading soon. Sometimes my graphics card goes demonic and shows me things on the screen I'm not supposed to see...
