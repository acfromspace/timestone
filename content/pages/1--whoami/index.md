Greetings traveler, I'm AC De Leon.

I'm a <a href="https://github.com/acfromspace" target="_blank">software engineer</a> and <a href="https://acfromspace.itch.io/" target="_blank">game developer</a>.
Recently graduated from San Diego State University with a B.S. in Computer Science.
I manage this blog filled with software development and personal development in order to document my experiences.

For my everyday learnings, they will be located in <a href="https://github.com/acfromspace/infinitygauntlet" target="_blank">the Infinity Gauntlet</a>!

Forever learning because nobody really knows everything.

Here is my
