Greetings traveler, I'm AC De Leon.

I'm a <a href="https://github.com/acfromspace" target="_blank">front-end developer</a> and <a href="https://acfromspace.itch.io/" target="_blank">game developer</a>.
I have recently graduated from San Diego State University with a B.S. in Computer Science.
I manage this blog filled with software development and personal development in order to document my learnings.

I create <a href="https://unsplash.com/@acfromspace" target="_blank">photography</a>,
<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=hzmfGUfRsQo" target="_blank">videography</a>, and do
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/standardworkout" target="_blank">powerlifting</a> when I'm not otherwise coding.

Forever learning because nobody really knows everything.

Here is my <a href="https://resume.creddle.io/resume/ayjgtizt9n7" target="_blank">resume</a>, let's connect!
