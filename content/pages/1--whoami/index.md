Greetings traveler, I'm AC De Leon.

I'm a <a href="https://spacestone.netlify.com" target="_blank">front-end developer</a>, <a href="https://acfromspace.itch.io/" target="_blank">game developer</a>,
and creative director for the <a href="https://aztecgamelab.com/" target="_blank">Aztec Game Lab</a>.
I have recently graduated from San Diego State University with a B.S. in Computer Science.
I manage this blog filled with software development and personal development in order to document my learnings.

I create <a href="https://unsplash.com/@acfromspace" target="_blank">photography</a>,
<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=hzmfGUfRsQo" target="_blank">videography</a>,
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/acfromspace/im-not-yours-anymore" target="_blank">lo-fi</a>, and do
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/standardworkout" target="_blank">powerlifting</a> when I'm not otherwise coding.</p>

Forever learning because nobody really knows everything.
