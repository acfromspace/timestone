Greetings traveler, I'm AC De Leon.

I'm a <a href="https://github.com/acfromspace" target="_blank">software engineer</a> and <a href="https://acfromspace.itch.io/" target="_blank">game developer</a>.
Recently graduated from San Diego State University with a B.S. in Computer Science.
I manage this blog filled with software development and personal development in order to document my experiences.

For my everyday learnings, they will be located in <a href="https://github.com/acfromspace/infinitygauntlet" target="_blank">the Infinity Gauntlet</a>!

I create <a href="https://unsplash.com/@acfromspace" target="_blank">photography</a>, <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=hzmfGUfRsQo" target="_blank">videography</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2rHqW4g_iM" target="_blank">lo-fi</a>, and do <a href="https://tinyurl.com/standardworkout" target="_blank">powerlifting</a> when I'm not otherwise coding.

Forever learning because nobody really knows everything.

Here is my
