[_timestone_](https://timestone.netlify.com) is a website with the following features:

- **Blazing fast loading thanks to [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).** Get all the benefits of static websites with none of the limitations. Gatsby sites are fully functional React apps, so you can create high-quality, dynamic web apps, from blogs to ecommerce sites to user dashboards.

- **Customizability.** Within the `src` folder, all adaptable files to be made by the user are available. One can even go further to possibly add in aesthetic javascript node packages to add visuals.

- **Hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).** Netlify offers both web-based and command-line interfaces in order to adapt to an extremely easy and intuitive user interface dependent on the user.
